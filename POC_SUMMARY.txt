COMPLETE JIRA AUTOMATION POC - READY FOR GITHUB!

==============================================================================

WHAT I CREATED:

New Folder: GitHub-POC-Automation

Files Created:
1. daily_automation.py (Main automation engine - 350 lines)
2. .github/workflows/daily-automation.yml (GitHub Actions workflow)
3. README.md (Project documentation)
4. SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md (Step-by-step setup guide)
5. requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
6. .gitignore (Git ignore rules)
7. PUSH_TO_GITHUB.md (Instructions to push)
8. POC_SUMMARY.txt (This file)

==============================================================================

WHAT THE AUTOMATION DOES DAILY:

1. Completes 3-5 Tickets Per Developer
   - Randomly selects assigned tickets
   - Transitions them to Done status
   - Simulates daily work completion

2. Adds 5 New Tickets to Backlog
   - Uses task names from your Excel sheet
   - Random complexity and priority
   - 30% chance of priority override scenario
   - All unassigned initially

3. Assigns Unassigned Tickets
   - Loads developer readiness scores
   - Checks current workload in real-time
   - Calculates best match using formula:
     Score = (Readiness × 10) + Availability - Workload Penalty
   - Assigns to highest scoring developer
   - Adds explanation comment

4. Handles Priority Override
   - Detects when requester sets wrong priority
   - Adds comment explaining override
   - Assigns with correct priority

==============================================================================

TEAM CONFIGURATION:

3 Developers:
- Person 1: prashantyelpale63@gmail.com (You)
- Person 2: prashantyelpale01@gmail.com (Prashant)
- Person 3: prashantyelpale7@gmail.com (Rohit Kumar)

Jira Configuration:
- Server: https://prashantyelpale63.atlassian.net
- Project: SCRUM
- API Token: Already configured

==============================================================================

SCHEDULE:

Runs Daily at 9:00 AM CET (7:00 AM UTC)

Can also run manually anytime from GitHub Actions tab

==============================================================================

NEXT STEPS FOR YOU:

Step 1: Push to GitHub (5 minutes)
   - Use GitHub Desktop (easiest)
   - Or use command line with token
   - See PUSH_TO_GITHUB.md for instructions

Step 2: Add Secrets (3 minutes)
   - Go to repo Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Add 4 secrets:
     1. JIRA_API_TOKEN
     2. JIRA_EMAIL
     3. JIRA_SERVER
     4. JIRA_PROJECT_KEY
   - See SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for values

Step 3: Enable Actions (1 minute)
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Enable workflows

Step 4: Test Run (2 minutes)
   - Actions tab → Run workflow
   - Wait for completion
   - Check Jira for results

Step 5: Verify (1 minute)
   - Check Jira board
   - See completed tickets
   - See new tickets
   - See assignments

==============================================================================

EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIRST RUN:

In Your Jira:
- 3-5 tickets per developer marked as Done
- 5 new tickets added to backlog
- New tickets assigned to developers
- Comments explaining assignments
- Balanced workload

In GitHub Actions:
- Green checkmark (success)
- Logs showing all operations
- Artifacts with detailed logs

==============================================================================

MONITORING:

Daily Checks:
- Actions tab: See if workflow ran successfully
- Jira board: See tickets completed and assigned
- Logs: Download from workflow artifacts

Success Indicators:
- Green checkmarks in Actions
- Tickets completed daily
- New tickets added daily
- Assignments balanced
- Comments added to tickets

==============================================================================

COST:

GitHub Actions: FREE
- 2,000 minutes/month free
- This uses ~2 minutes per day
- Total: ~60 minutes/month
- Plenty of free quota!

==============================================================================

POC SUCCESS CRITERIA:

After 1 Week:
- 7 successful daily runs
- 21-35 tickets completed (3-5 per dev per day)
- 35 new tickets added (5 per day)
- All tickets assigned
- Workload balanced
- Priority overrides working

After 2 Weeks:
- 14 successful daily runs
- Consistent performance
- No manual intervention needed
- Team satisfied with assignments

==============================================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Issue: Workflow not running
Fix: Check if secrets are added correctly

Issue: Authentication failed
Fix: Verify JIRA_API_TOKEN is correct

Issue: No tickets found
Fix: Check JIRA_PROJECT_KEY is SCRUM

Issue: Tickets not completing
Fix: Check if tickets have "Done" transition available

==============================================================================

ADVANTAGES OF THIS POC:

1. Fully Automated
   - No manual intervention needed
   - Runs daily automatically
   - Handles all scenarios

2. Realistic Simulation
   - Completes tickets (simulates work)
   - Adds new tickets (simulates requests)
   - Assigns intelligently (real algorithm)
   - Handles edge cases (priority override)

3. Production-Ready Code
   - Error handling
   - Logging
   - Comments
   - Clean structure

4. Easy to Monitor
   - GitHub Actions logs
   - Jira comments
   - Clear success/failure indicators

5. Zero Cost
   - GitHub Actions free tier
   - No server needed
   - No maintenance

==============================================================================

AFTER POC SUCCESS:

When This Works Well:
1. Show to team in meeting
2. Get approval for production
3. Deploy to Syngenta Jira
4. Update with real team members
5. Add Smartsheet integration
6. Go live!

Timeline:
- Week 1-2: POC running (this)
- Week 3: Team demo and approval
- Week 4: Production deployment
- Week 5: Go live with Syngenta
